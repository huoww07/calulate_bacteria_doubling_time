class doubling_time.GrowthCurve

Methods:
1.  read_data(data_file): data_file has to be xlsx format, first two columns are
time in minutes and time in hours, followed by as many samples as needed.
2.  fit_sigmoid(plot=False): fit the sigmoid function to read data.
3.  show_result: print result table to screen. With 'plot=True', the plot will be
printed on screen.
4.  save_result('result.xlsx'): save the result table in file named 'result.xlsx'.

Attributes:
1.  data: DataFrame, shape (n_time_points, n_samples+2). Input data file in pandas
DataFrame float_format.
2.  strain_name: list, shape (n_samples). Strain names in list.
3.  doubling_time: array, shape(n_samples). Calculated doubling time for each samples as input order
4.  max_growth_time: array, shape(n_samples). The time point (in hours) along the
growth curve that the doubling time was calculated, which represents the maximum growth rate.
5.  r2: array, shape(n_samples). Calculated r-square using fitted sigmoid
function
6.  result: DataFrame, shape (n_samples+1, 4). Return result containing: strain_name, doubling_time,
max_growth_time and r2.
